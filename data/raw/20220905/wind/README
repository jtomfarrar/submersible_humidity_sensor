2018/05/24 Ben Greenwood; Create uop_plot.m

This code is capable of processing and plotting the following sensors:
 * ASIMET loggers
 * ASIMET standalone (Compact Flash + SD versions)
 * Rotronic
 * SBE39AT
 * WXT520 (SD version)
 * Lascar
 * Campbell systems(2019)

Instructions
==============
0) You should have uop_decode.m, README, and a dependencies sub-directory.
1) Modify the top section of uop_decode.m to describe your project.
2) Place raw files in same directory as uop_decode.m
3) Use Matlab to run script uop_decode.m
4) After the script completes, all output will be organized in a subdirectory


Output from this code is organized in the following way. Note that all raw 
files and processing code is also included into the output directory so that
the output directory is capable of self-replication.
