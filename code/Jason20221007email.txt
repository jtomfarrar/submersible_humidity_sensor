Hi Guys
A thousand apologies, but I thought I had sent this data along.

Some notes:
603, 604, and 605 are the RBR temp probes.
I want to confirm this at home but I believe that 603 has the fat temp
probe, 604 is a skinny probe with no stainless mesh, and 605 is a skinny
probe with stainless mesh.
The giant excel file that begins with "rot_..." is the RH/temp probe
that I set up next to the RBR probes.
I'll send the wind data in another email.
The temp probes were started at noon local time on 05Sep22.
The water spray started at 12:05pm local, and sprayed again every hour
after that.
I stopped collecting data after the 5:05pm spray.
Jason
