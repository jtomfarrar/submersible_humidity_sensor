Hi Guys

I figured out how to log data with timestamps, and I attempted to log data from the temperature bridge as well.
The time is difficult to set on the bridge, but should be very close.

The big things to note are that you can see that I move the standard probe into the next test environment several minutes before I move the probes.
The probes started and ended the run in a box that hopefully dampened otherwise uncontrollable temperature activity.
I tried to give the probes a good shake as I transitioned them from place to place.
