# Ideas for sampling protocol for prototype instrument (2025/02/13)
- At start of sampling, record ship's position and time in UTC (preferably get ship's GPS log)
- Record met obs (seas, wind speed, local time, cloud cover)
- Submerge sensor (thermistor sting) for at least 5 minutes
- Let instrument bob for at least 5 minutes
